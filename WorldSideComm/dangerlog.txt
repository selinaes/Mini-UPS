1. Java Versions & IntelliJ IDEA. Especially if created project on one machine, then move to VCM.
- Make sure Java and JDK versions are the same everywhere. Mind the following:
(a) Try "java --version"
(b) IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> Project -> Project SDK
(c) IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> Project -> Project Language Level (Use SDK Default)
(d) IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> Modules -> Language Level (Use Project Default)
(e) IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> SDKs -> notice the path. /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.17.0-openjdk-amd64

2. Gradle Versions & gradle including libraries
(a) "gradle --version"
(b) IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle -> Gradle JVM
(c) IntelliJ IDEA: File -> Project Structure -> Libraries -> See there is a list of gradle libraries
(d) Project Tree: External Libraries: See a list of Gradle: xxxx libraries
(e) Project Tree: gradle -> wrapper -> gradle-wrapper.properties -> distributionUrl: mind the version!

3. First when I wanted to change simspeed, we set Simspeed = 50 when sending UCommands. But this caused problem -
the world's database will be 'down' when we reached the "arrive warehouse" event. We finally realized that this is
caused by the simspeed change, and if we don't set simspeed, that would be fine.

4. When we connect with one Amazon group, both of us did not receive the ack that we sent out to each other, so
our process got stuck. Later, I figured that a danger possibility -  even though we should only handle the same
sequence number once, we should ack whenever we receive the request, this is to avoid just send the ack once and
then the other side miss it and then they will never receive a second ack, even if they keep sending the request.

5. Then, we still cannot receive each other's ack. The other Amazon group found that their protocol is a little
different from ours - we deleted a message, but they did not delete it as we discussed. This caused their acks
to be in position 8, while our acks is in position7, which caused the problem.
